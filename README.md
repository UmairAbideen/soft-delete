# Laravel 10 Soft Deletion Functionality
 This repository demonstrates soft deletion in a Laravel application using Eloquent. Soft deletion allows you to "delete" records from the database without permanently removing them, keeping the data intact for possible restoration later.

**Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the database and run migrations (php artisan migrate).
3. Access the Users List to see all active users.
4. Soft delete, restore, and permanently delete users using the provided routes.
